# Wine-Quality

A wide range of measures can affect the quality of wine, for example, grape types, wine 
brands, climates, and so on. In general, the wine quality is evaluated in two parts. One 
part measures physicochemical features, like alcohol level, pH value, residual sugar, 
acidity levels, etc., for further analysis and production. At the same time, the other one is 
sensory tests which are mainly carried out by wine specialists. However, the taste of 
experienced experts is subjective, and the procedures are often complex, costly, and 
time-consuming, while different people will have divergent senses of what constitutes 
good or bad quality. To solve this problem, machine learning algorithms are applied to find 
a model to predict the wine quality based on various wine physicochemical 
measurements, providing an objective perspective to the traditional wine assessment.
